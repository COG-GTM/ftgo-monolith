= FTGO Monolith

This is the monolithic version of the https://github.com/microservices-patterns/ftgo-application[FTGO application] from my book https://microservices.io/book[Microservices patterns].
It's used to illustrate how to refactor a monolithic application to services.

## Logging Configuration

The application uses structured JSON logging to enable centralized log aggregation. All logs are output to stdout in JSON format using the Logstash encoder.

**Key Features:**
- Structured JSON output to stdout (no file-based logging)
- Application name included in all log entries: `"application_name":"ftgo-monolith"`
- MDC field support for `requestId` and `userId` when available
- Configurable via `logback-spring.xml` in the ftgo-application module

**Dependencies:**
- `logstash-logback-encoder:7.3` for JSON log formatting

This configuration supports modern log aggregation systems and centralized monitoring.
